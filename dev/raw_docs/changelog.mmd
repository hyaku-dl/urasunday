## Added

- `-on`/`--overwrite_not`, `-op`/`--overwrite_prompt`, and `-opn`/`--overwrite_prompt_not` flags for the `dl` subcommand.

## Changed

- Made the app log the `log path` even when loading, so that the user will know where to find the said file when it gets stuck while loading.
- .AppImage so that you can run the cli by appending the `cli` subcommand to the command for running the said AppImage. For example, `./ura.AppImage cli [flags]`.

## Fixed

- `overwrite` settings not being followed (i.e. `overwrite` set to False, yet the chapter that is already downloaded is being overwritten).
- Once and for all, the fucking python imports, for fuck's sake.
- Improved documentation!
