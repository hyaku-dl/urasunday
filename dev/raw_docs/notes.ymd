## Versioning System

Hyaku uses modified semver. This is due to the fact that I believe that I, the developer of this app, introduces too much breaking change to the API without noticeable changes to the user interface and/or experience. And such, I have decided to use the following versioning system:

Given a version number `user.dev.minor.patch`, increment the:

- `user` version when you make any changes to the user interface/experience. This does not include improvements on loading times, despite being well within the user experience umbrella.
- `dev` version when you make incompatible API changes,
- `minor` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `patch` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Anything else adheres to the semantic versioning 2.0.0.

If in doubt, please do not hesitate to visit [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

                bprv --> ba(bump `pi` to `alpha`)
                ba --> bp([bump `patch`])
            e_pr --> |alpha| bb(bump to `beta`)
                bb --> r0([reset version/s below it to `0` or `none`])
            e_pr --> |beta| br(bump to `rc`) --> r0
            e_pr --> |rc| rn(reset to `none`) --> r0
        VB --> |others| bsv(bump specified version) --> r0
```

## Changelog

As used in the changelog, the following types of changes shall have the following implications, of which, their allowed version bumps should be everything, unless explicably stated otherwise:

- `Added` for new features.
    - user
    - dev
    - minor
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
    - user
    - dev
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
    - patch
- `Removed` for now removed features.
    - user
    - dev
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

Example format:

```md
## 1.0.0.0-rc.1 (pre-release identifier bump)

Concisely describe changes in this release.

## Documentation

The documentation system is a custom solution.

Documenting it will be futile, as it is ever-changing, tuned to the developer's needs.
