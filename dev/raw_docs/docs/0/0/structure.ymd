title: ura's Structure
---

ura is a very basic application, yet it grew to a large size. As a one-man army, it is necessary for me to write this, as to not get lost in this chaos that I have created.

I, however, procrastinated in writing this, and thus, is completely empty at the moment.

<!-- *The abyss stares back at me, as to coerce this soul of mine into writing this mess.* -->
